16:17:39	 From Lida : BoatingTest
16:17:39	 From ChenYun Zhang : student
16:20:51	 From Franklin Bado : attr_accessor
16:21:38	 From Alex E (she/her) : how do you type in multiple places like that again?  How you just added the colons?
16:21:49	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Option + click
16:21:53	 From Samir Triande : Was just about to ask. That was dope
16:22:11	 From Samir Triande : Thank you Annie
16:22:16	 From hortencia : ^^^
16:22:33	 From Lida : :)
16:24:14	 From Franklin Bado : student_name right
16:24:15	 From Dong Xia : student_name
16:24:26	 From Dong Xia : in accessor
16:24:26	 From Franklin Bado : ^^
16:24:53	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Franklin ++
16:24:55	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Dong++
16:25:02	 From Jade Decordova : LOL
16:25:08	 From Alex E (she/her) : did we include @@all << self in the botingtest.rb ?
16:25:23	 From Emmanuel Jose : @Alex, yes
16:25:28	 From Franklin Bado : I ll declare mine as Franklin += .. I got more to offer now
16:25:40	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : hahah love that ^
16:26:19	 From Franklin Bado : Eric
16:26:22	 From Dong Xia : sandy
16:26:27	 From hortencia : patrick
16:26:46	 From hortencia : Squid ward
16:26:49	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Sandy is the squirrel in the astronaut costume
16:27:15	 From Lida : Sandy = squirrel
16:27:37	 From ChenYun Zhang : Sandy = “squirrel”
16:27:39	 From Kalkidan Taye : She is my favorite…such an independent squirrel and she knows karate, and she is a scientist…
16:27:46	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : ^^
16:27:57	 From Dong Xia : ka-ra-te—
16:28:30	 From Waverley Leung : 🥋
16:35:08	 From Jade Decordova : Invoke the method
16:35:22	 From Samantha Balgobin : In run.rb?
16:35:27	 From Franklin Bado : Invoke the method with a instructor in the rub file
16:36:45	 From Alex E (she/her) : That’s so cool that it goes across files
16:43:47	 From Franklin Bado : Passed
16:47:38	 From Alex E (she/her) : so what would the code in the method be changed to?
16:52:17	 From Anna Kim : should we get used to coming up with our own helper methods depending on the deliverables?
16:52:48	 From Anna Kim : because in many methods, we had to do multiple loops because we didn’t create a helper method (i.e. all_tests)
16:52:56	 From hortencia : ^^
16:53:07	 From Alex E (she/her) : could passed_students also use select?         self.all_passed_tests.self {&:student}    ?
16:53:36	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Helper method definitely helps makes your code drier and you can reuse helper methods
16:53:48	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Sandi Metz <- the author
16:54:09	 From Emmanuel Jose : Sylwia, can you slack that book?
16:54:11	 From Anna Kim : thank you sylwia & annie
16:54:16	 From Jade Decordova : Can you send me resources from her free or for purchase!!
16:54:22	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you!
16:54:55	 From Alex E (she/her) : could passed_students also use select?         self.all_passed_tests.self {&:student}    ?
16:55:10	 From wilson ng : I sent the amazon link for the book
16:55:14	 From Alex E (she/her) : could passed_students also use select?         self.all_passed_tests.select {&:student}    ?
16:55:19	 From Alex E (she/her) : DX  ok
16:55:20	 From Emmanuel Jose : We’re bending time
16:55:22	 From Jade Decordova : I like it here
16:55:22	 From Franklin Bado : Do the timer
16:55:33	 From Jade Decordova : :D
16:55:37	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you Wilson!
16:56:54	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : I missed some questions?
16:57:21	 From Alex E (she/her) : I am lol
16:57:52	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : And what was the question about cloning?forking?
16:59:18	 From Emmanuel Jose : Ekaterina, Franklin asked how both partners can submit the lab. Sylwia said to have both partners have the same copy of their code, and then do learn submit
17:00:00	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Emmanuel, thank you so much! I had this question too. :)
17:00:24	 From Emmanuel Jose : No problem!
17:00:25	 From Anna Kim : thank you~
17:00:29	 From wilson ng : My hashsketball was like 300 lines  😂
17:00:34	 From Anna Kim : ^ wilson!
17:02:04	 From Emmanuel Jose : Is the screen frozen for anyone else?
17:02:05	 From Christy Tropila :  cant see what you are typing
17:02:07	 From Alex E (she/her) : Are you typing?
17:02:10	 From Samantha Balgobin : I think you are stuck
17:02:11	 From Dong Xia : i don’t see any thing
17:02:12	 From ChenYun Zhang : i can’t see anything
17:02:22	 From Dong Xia : good
17:02:22	 From David Felix : good
17:06:59	 From Christy Tropila : should the param be student_name ?
17:08:43	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : Christy ++
17:12:43	 From Franklin Bado : On the read me right, it says “`Instructor#pass_student` should take in a student instance and test name.” So is it easier to go to BoatingTest since we have access to the test and the student by the bridge?
17:13:12	 From ChenYun Zhang : line 48 has a comma
17:13:27	 From ChenYun Zhang : ok
17:14:48	 From Annie Zheng (she/her) : @Franklin, yes because we need information about the student and we’re in the instructor file right now. We need to go through BoatingTest since that’s where the single source of truth is
17:24:19	 From Anna Kim : could you explain line 55-56 one more time?
17:24:22	 From Anna Kim : just the logic part
17:25:14	 From Samantha Balgobin : Isn’t name_str an instance and not a string?
17:25:56	 From Anna Kim : @sam i think it is a student name
17:27:03	 From Samantha Balgobin : @Anna thanks, I think I got confused bc I have a diff variable name
17:27:22	 From Alex E (she/her) : Thank you so much Sylwia and Annie!
17:27:35	 From Anna Kim : @sam np! i think sylwia added _str to avoid confusion too haha
17:28:01	 From Anna Kim : @sam with other @name inst.variables
17:28:19	 From Franklin Bado : Self …
17:28:57	 From Samantha Balgobin : @Anna, yeah, the deliverable says that #pass_student should take in a student instance and test name. Maybe i missed something visually
17:29:40	 From Emmanuel Jose : Sylwia, will the complete code be included in the lecture notes/readme?
17:30:01	 From Emmanuel Jose : This one
17:30:02	 From Anna Kim : GitHub solution doesn’t seem to have any of the helper methods
17:30:22	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you!
17:30:27	 From Anna Kim : she did!
17:30:32	 From Anna Kim : thank youuu
17:30:36	 From Samantha Balgobin : Can we go back to the pass_test method for a second
17:31:48	 From Samantha Balgobin : Gotcha, yeah I did it with the student instance passed so I got confused lol, thank you
17:33:06	 From Samantha Balgobin : Thank you very much Sylwia!
17:33:19	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Thank you very much!
17:33:44	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Cash Register please!
17:33:48	 From Anna Kim : ^
17:33:49	 From Emmanuel Jose : I would love walkthrough videos with the practice labs!
17:34:27	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Could you please make a video for Register lab/
17:34:28	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : ?
17:34:54	 From Anna Kim : thank you so much~
17:34:58	 From Kalkidan Taye : Thank you!
17:35:01	 From Waverley Leung : Thank you so much!
17:35:08	 From Christy Tropila : Thank you :)!
17:35:10	 From Emmanuel Jose : Thank you Sylwia and Annie!
17:35:17	 From David Felix : Thank you!
17:35:21	 From Anna Kim : ooh how should we access this boating lab
17:35:24	 From Ekaterina Zarudnaya : Thank you so much!
17:35:27	 From ChenYun Zhang : bye
